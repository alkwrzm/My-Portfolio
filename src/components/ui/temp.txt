import { Project } from "@prisma/client"

// This must remain a Client Component if we use useState. 
// However, the page was Server Component before. 
// We can make the Page server, and extract the Card to Client.
// Let's refactor into Page (Server) -> Grid -> Card (Client).
// But for simplicity/speed in this step, I will make the page Client and fetch data via props? 
// No, standard pattern in App Router is Page(Server) fetches data.
// So I will create a Client Component for the Card.
// Wait, I can't easily import a new file without 2 steps.
// I will just make the whole page a Client Component and fetch data via a server wrapper... 
// OR just put the client logic in a separate component in the same file? No, file-level directives.
// I will rewrite this file to be a Server Component that renders a Client Component List.
// Actually, I can just use the `Projects` component logic I just wrote? No, different layout.

// PLAN:
// 1. Rename this file's content to a new client component `ProjectList`.
// 2. Make `page.tsx` fetch data and render `ProjectList`.

// Since I cannot create new file easily without clutter, I will inline the client component if possible? No.
// I'll just make the Page.tsx a Server Component that creates the data, and imports a new Client Component.
// Actually, the user's previous request was to fix the "View All" page.
// I will create `src/components/ProjectGrid.tsx` (Client) and use it in `page.tsx`.

// STEP 1: Create ProjectGrid.tsx
// STEP 2: Update page.tsx

// Wait, I'm in the middle of a `write_to_file`. I'll do `ProjectGrid.tsx` first.

// Cancel that, I will just make `ProjectCarousel` a separate component `src/components/ProjectCarousel.tsx` 
// and import it in both `Projects.tsx` (Home) and `projects/page.tsx` (Archive).
// That is cleaner.
// But I already updated `Projects.tsx` with inline code.
// I will correct `projects/page.tsx` now to use the same logic locally or just accept that I need a client component for the carousel.

// I will create a dedicated Client Component for the Carousel.
// `src/components/ui/ImageCarousel.tsx`
